# vector-angle-calculator
A simple Python tool to calculate the angle between 2D and 3D vectors using NumPy
## Features
- Uses **NumPy** for high_precision math.
- works with both 2D and 3D vectors.
  
Below is an example execution of the program:  
Enter x-component for Vector A: 1  
Enter y-component for Vector A: 0  
Enter z-component for Vector A: 0  

Enter x-component for Vector B: 0  
Enter y-component for Vector B: 1  
Enter z-component for Vector B: 0  

 The angle between the vectors is : 90.0 degree
